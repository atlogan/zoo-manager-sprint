    "## Part 2: Python Group Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Build upon the initial concepts from Part 1 by creating a more sophisticated Zoo Manager system, **split into four distinct modules**. Each student in a group of four will own one module, ensuring a clear division of work while still collaborating to produce a single, integrated codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Four Modules?\n",
    "- **Module A**: Core `Animal` classes (parent and children).\n",
    "- **Module B**: A `Zoo` class responsible for storing/managing `Animal` objects.\n",
    "- **Module C**: File handling and error handling (reading/writing animal data).\n",
    "- **Module D**: The main driver script (user interface, menu, or demonstration logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the two-week sprint, you will have:\n",
    "- Practiced Agile-like processes (sprint planning, daily standups, sprint review, retrospective).\n",
    "- Established a **robust Git workflow** with feature branches, code reviews, and merges.\n",
    "- Applied Python OOP concepts in a real-world-like setting.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Sprint Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sprint Planning Session (Day 1)**\n",
    "   - Each group meets to define the sprint goal:\n",
    "     > “Build a simple Zoo Manager system with multiple classes, file handling, error handling, and a demonstration script.”\n",
    "   - Decide how to split the work **by module**:\n",
    "     - **Module A**: `animals.py`  \n",
    "       - The parent `Animal` class plus at least two child classes (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`).\n",
    "       - Methods like `make_sound()` or any other behavior.\n",
    "     - **Module B**: `zoo.py`  \n",
    "       - A `Zoo` class that can hold a list of `Animal` objects (aggregates or composes from Module A).\n",
    "       - Methods to add, remove, and list animals, etc.\n",
    "     - **Module C**: `file_io.py`  \n",
    "       - Functions or classes that handle saving/loading the zoo’s animals to/from a file (e.g., `zoo_data.txt`).\n",
    "       - Should include try-except blocks for robust error handling (missing file, invalid data format, etc.).\n",
    "     - **Module D**: `main.py`  \n",
    "       - The \"driver\" or demonstration script that ties everything together.\n",
    "       - Imports the other modules, creates a `Zoo` object, prompts user for actions (or runs a scenario automatically).\n",
    "       - Calls the methods from the `Zoo` class (add animals, remove animals, load/save from file, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Assign one module per student**. Each student is fully responsible for completing and documenting their assigned module.\n",
    "   - If a particular module needs more than one contributor, break it down into smaller subtasks but keep the module lead clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Daily Standups**\n",
    "   - Every day, each student posts a **short text update** (Teams Daily Standup channel) with:\n",
    "     - **Yesterday’s progress** (e.g., “Added saving function in `file_io.py`.”)\n",
    "     - **Today’s plan** (e.g., “Implement error handling for invalid data.”)\n",
    "     - **Any blockers** (e.g., “Merge conflict in `zoo.py` with John’s changes.”)\n",
    "   - The Scrum Master:\n",
    "     - Ensures everyone is on track.\n",
    "     - Coordinates help if someone is blocked.\n",
    "     - Communicates with the instructor if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Git Workflow with Branching**\n",
    "   - Create a **shared GitHub repository** named (for example) `zoo-manager-sprint`.\n",
    "   - **Module-based Branches**:\n",
    "     - Each student creates a **feature branch** for their module (e.g., `feature/module-A-animals`).\n",
    "     - Commit your changes to your branch as you progress.\n",
    "   - **Pull Requests & Code Reviews**:\n",
    "     - When your module is ready, open a Pull Request (PR) into `main` (or into a `dev` branch first—your choice).\n",
    "     - At least one teammate (often the Scrum Master) reviews your PR, suggests changes, or approves it.\n",
    "     - After approval, merge the branch.  \n",
    "   - This ensures each module is independently developed, reviewed, and then integrated without breaking main.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Two-Week Timeline**\n",
    "   - **Week 1**: \n",
    "     - Day 1: Sprint planning + repository setup. Decide module owners.\n",
    "     - Days 2-5: Develop modules in separate branches, hold daily standups, start merging PRs once modules are stable.\n",
    "   - **Week 2**:\n",
    "     - Continue daily standups, refine modules, fix bugs, finalize merges.\n",
    "     - Conduct code reviews, add any enhancements or documentation needed.\n",
    "     - Prepare for the Sprint Review presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sprint Review & Retrospective (End of Week 2)**\n",
    "   - Present your final **integrated** code to the instructor.\n",
    "   - Demonstrate a run of `main.py`:\n",
    "     - Show animals being created, added to the `Zoo`, saved/loaded from a file, and how errors are handled.\n",
    "   - **Retrospective**:\n",
    "     - Discuss what worked well in your Agile-like process (e.g., “Daily standups caught problems early.”).\n",
    "     - Identify improvements for future sprints (e.g., “We should have integrated modules more frequently.”).\n",

    "### Detailed Requirements & Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Module A: Animals (Parent & Children)**\n",
    "   - A **parent class** `Animal` with at least these features:\n",
    "     - An `__init__` method for general attributes (`name`, `species`, etc.).\n",
    "     - A `make_sound()` method (or multiple relevant methods) with a default implementation.\n",
    "   - **Two or more child classes** (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`, `Reptile`).\n",
    "     - Each should override `make_sound()` (or other methods) to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "   - Should be in a file named `animals.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Module B: Zoo**\n",
    "   - A `Zoo` class, in **`zoo.py`**.\n",
    "   - Manages a list (or dictionary) of `Animal` objects (imported from `animals.py`).\n",
    "   - Methods might include:\n",
    "     - `add_animal(animal)`\n",
    "     - `remove_animal(animal_name_or_id)`\n",
    "     - `list_animals()` (prints or returns a list of current animals)\n",
    "     - Possibly searching or updating animal info.\n",
    "   - Must be flexible enough to handle future child classes seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Module C: File I/O & Error Handling**\n",
    "   - **`file_io.py`** containing functions or classes that:\n",
    "     - Save the current list of animals to a text file or JSON file (e.g., `zoo_data.txt`).\n",
    "     - Load animals from the file and reconstruct `Animal` objects to be inserted into the `Zoo`.\n",
    "     - Uses try-except blocks to handle:\n",
    "       - Missing files (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).\n",
    "       - Malformed data (maybe skip bad lines, log an error, etc.).\n",
    "     - Potential user input errors, if applicable.\n",
    "   - The `Zoo` class or the `main.py` script should call these functions at appropriate times (start or exit of the program, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Module D: Main Script / Driver**\n",
    "   - A script named **`main.py`** that **ties everything together**:\n",
    "     - Imports from the other modules (`animals`, `zoo`, `file_io`).\n",
    "     - Creates a `Zoo` instance.\n",
    "     - Demonstrates adding animals manually or loading from file.\n",
    "     - Provides an interface (command line or menu) to:\n",
    "       - List animals.\n",
    "       - Add a new animal.\n",
    "       - Save or load data from file.\n",
    "       - Remove an animal, etc.\n",
    "     - Error handling or graceful exits where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Git & Agile Process**\n",
    "   - Each module must be developed on its own feature branch and go through a Pull Request before merging.\n",
    "   - Code reviews are **mandatory**. At least one student besides the author must review each Pull Request.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Presentation**\n",
    "   - Show a brief demo of the integrated system:\n",
    "     - Running `python main.py`.\n",
    "     - Demonstrating key features (e.g., new animals, loading from file).\n",
    "     - Showing how errors (invalid files, etc.) are handled gracefully.\n",
    "   - Summarize your group’s retrospective findings."
